## Main goal
Make a website to do Machine Vision filters for BIG MONEY (no watermark, no stupid shit)
## Current Goals
* Client-side image processing
* Use OpenCV for filters
* Display Image by Download
* Very Simple UI
## Current Hurdles
* Learn OpenCV.js
* Hosting
* Are OpenCV libraries too big?
* If library is too big we can consider:
